## Hands-On Practicals

The coursework covers key areas of ethical hacking and network defense through structured, reproducible experiments.

- **Network Scanning & Enumeration** – Discovery and vulnerability assessment using Nmap and Nessus.
- **Exploitation Frameworks** – Payload delivery and post-exploitation with Metasploit and EternalBlue.
- **Intrusion Detection** – Rule-based traffic monitoring using Snort IDS.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks** – ARP spoofing, SSL stripping, and DoS in LAN environments.
- **Social Engineering** – Credential harvesting via the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET).
- **Secure Communications** – VPN setup, tunneling protocols, and encryption validation.
